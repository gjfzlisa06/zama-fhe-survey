## 🏛️ Project Background

In today's data-driven world, collecting honest feedback is crucial for improving products and services. However, traditional survey systems face significant challenges:

- **Lack of transparency:** Participants cannot verify if their responses are accurately recorded
- **Data tampering risks:** Survey results can be manipulated after collection
- **Privacy concerns:** Respondents may hesitate to provide honest feedback due to privacy concerns

FHE Survey leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to tackle these issues. By performing computations on encrypted data directly on-chain, the system ensures:

- Complete transparency and verifiability of all survey operations
- Immutable records that cannot be altered after submission
- Protection of respondent privacy while maintaining data integrity
- Trustless environment where results can be verified by anyone
