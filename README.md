## 🏛️ Project Background

Since ancient times, lotteries have been a popular way for people to chase their dreams and wealth.  
However, they have always faced significant challenges:  
- **Lack of transparency**: Participants cannot fully verify the fairness of the draw  
- **Data tampering risks**: Results can be manipulated due to insider operations or system vulnerabilities  
- **Privacy concerns**: Players' participation information is often exposed  

FHE Lottery leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to tackle these issues.  
By performing computations on encrypted data directly on-chain, the system ensures:  

- Transparency and verifiability of all lottery operations  
- Immutable records that cannot be altered after creation  
- Protection of user privacy while maintaining fairness  

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Transparent Lottery System**: Manage rounds and ensure fair draws  
- **Ticket Participation**: Users can join lotteries securely  
- **Administrative Controls**: Authorized actions for creating rounds and managing draws  
- **Result Visibility**: Draw outcomes are verifiable and publicly accessible  
- **FHEVM Integration**: On-chain data encryption ensures trust and integrity  
- **Modern Web Interface**: User-friendly frontend with wallet connectivity  

### Privacy & Security
